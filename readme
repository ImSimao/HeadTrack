# Head Tracking Program

## Overview
This Python program utilizes OpenCV and Dlib to track head movements and detect eye closure using a webcam. It provides real-time feedback on the position of the head and whether the eyes are closed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat (Download from [Dlib's model files](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2))

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python dlib
   ```
3. Download the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` file and place it in the same directory as `main.py`.

## Usage
1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. The program will start capturing video from your webcam.

3. Use the following controls:
### Eye Controls
- Closing your eyes for 3 seconds will start/pause tracking.

### Keyboard Controls
- Press `p` to pause/resume tracking.
- Press `r` to reset the tracker.
- Press `q` to quit the program.

## Notes
- Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.
- Adjust the eye closure threshold in the code if necessary for better detection.
